 static const char *__doc_gr_gnugym_gnugym_moving_average_vect_ff = R"doc(<+description of block+>

Constructor Specific Documentation:

Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of gnugym::gnugym_moving_average_vect.

To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, gnugym::gnugym_moving_average_vect's constructor is in a private implementation class. gnugym::gnugym_moving_average_vect::make is the public interface for creating new instances.

Args:
    vlen : 
    bufferlen : )doc";
