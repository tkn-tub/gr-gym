## Implement Actor Critic network

This network learns two functions:

1. Actor: This takes as input the state of our environment and returns a
probability value for each action in its action space.
2. Critic: This takes as input the state of our environment and returns
an estimate of total rewards in the future.

In our implementation, they share the initial layer.
